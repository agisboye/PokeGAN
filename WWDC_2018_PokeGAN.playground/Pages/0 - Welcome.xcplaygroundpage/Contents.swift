 # Welcome
 
 This is my WWDC 2018 scholarship submission.\
 You will learn about generative adversarial networks, or GANs for short, which are one of the latest and most cutting edge developments in artificial intelligence. Finally there is an interactive demo running in real time.
 
 
 - Important:
 Preflight checklist:
    - Open the Assistant editor to experience the interactive content (⌥+⌘+⏎).
    - Ensure markup is being rendered (Editor → Show Rendered Markup).
